# RAG Formal Method Q&A with Groq and Open Source LLM Models

This Streamlit app allows users to perform question and answer (Q&A) operations on research papers using various LLM models and vector embeddings. The app leverages Groq AI and Hugging Face models for processing and querying document contexts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- LangChain (including `langchain_groq`, `langchain_openai`, `langchain_community`, etc.)
- OpenAI
- `python-dotenv` for environment variable management

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo-url.git
   cd your-repo-directory
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables:**

   Create a `.env` file in the same directory as `app.py` with the following content:

   ```env
   HF_TOKEN=your_hugging_face_token
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
   ```

## Usage

1. **Prepare Documents:**

   Create a `Documents` folder in the same directory as `app.py` and place all PDF files you want to use as context for Q&A.

2. **Run the Streamlit App:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Interact with the App:**

   - Use the sidebar to input your Groq API key and Hugging Face API key.
   - Click on "Document Embedding" to load and process the documents.
   - Select an LLM model from the dropdown menu and set the temperature for the model.
   - Enter your query in the text input box and view the response.

## Notes

- Ensure that the paths and API keys are correctly set up in the `.env` file.
- Adjust the paths and settings according to your local setup if needed.

## Acknowledgement

Special thanks to Krish Naikâ€™s for guidance.

## Troubleshooting

- If no documents are loaded, verify the file path and contents in the `Documents` folder.
- Check your API keys and ensure they are correct.
- For any errors, refer to the error messages displayed in the app or consult the LangChain documentation for additional guidance.
